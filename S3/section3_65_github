Setup online code repo with Github - Text directions and references
You can sign-up for a GitHub account at https://github.com/

Once signed-up, you can follow the steps in the video to create a new repository for your application.

If you chose SSH as the option to push existing repo, you will need to set up an SSH key unless you already have one.

To display your public SSH key:

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

If you don't have an SSH public key or are not sure, checkout the instructions here: https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys

When creating a GitHub repo for your application, you can click on the SSH button, then push existing repo:

git remote add origin git@github.com:yourgithubaccountname/test-app-6.git

git push -u origin master # Remember you only need to use this command the first time

To view remotes setup in your environment (from your app directory):

git remote -v

For future pushes to repository:

git push origin master

(My Notes below vvvvvv)

1) Generate ssh key
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "michaeljohnsargent@gmail.com"

2) Log into gitlab as root and create user (set as Admin), set password

3) Browse to D:\gitlab-projects

4) run git init my-first-project

5) create a file eg test.ps1 and save the changes

6) git status shows test.ps1 as an staged change
 PS D:\gitlab-projects\my-first-project> git status

 On branch master

 No commits yet

 Untracked files:
   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
         test.ps1

 nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
7) git add . to stage the changes

8) git commit -m "initial changes: add test.ps1" to commit the changes

9) git log --graph --all --oneline to display the history

10) On gitlab server, log in with your credentials and set password

11) Click create project 
    - enter Project Name:'my-first-project'
    - Capture project Url :http://192.168.56.101/michaeljohnsargent/my-first-project
    - set Visibility: Public
12) Click "Clone" button on project page
    - http://host.sargent.com/michaeljohnsargent/my-first-project.git

13) add remote server
      git remote add origin "http://192.168.56.101/michaeljohnsargent/my-first-project.git"
      ** will prompt user to log in
    - or -
      git@192.168.56.101:michaeljohnsargent/my-first-project.git

14) git remote -v to verify remote origin is set
    Result shown:
    origin  http://192.168.56.101/michaeljohnsargent/my-first-project.git (fetch)
    origin  http://192.168.56.101/michaeljohnsargent/my-first-project.git (push)

15) git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories to merge the remote history with the local history

16) git push origin master to push the local repository to gitlab server
